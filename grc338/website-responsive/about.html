                    One of the best things about ice cream is that, while almost everyone has a favorite flavor, most people don’t have the SAME favorite flavor. Every day our ice cream inventors wake up with one goal – to create someone’s
                    next favorite flavor. Sure, sometimes that thinking leads to some wacky stuff (hello “turkey dinner ice cream”, we’re talking about you!), but other times it yields Blueberries ‘n Cream or Mocha Almond Fudge. And those are the days we live for.
