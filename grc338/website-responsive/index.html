                <p>
                    Here at Sweetie's Ice Cream Parlor, we pride ourselves on giving you the best customer experience along with the tastiest ice cream in America. We have a variety of options available so make sure that you dont miss out
                    on our weekly specials! Moreover, our passion for ice cream constantly drives us to invent flavor combinations that are better and bolder and delicious...er. Not only does that take creativity, it takes fresh, high
                    quality ingredients. To us, it’s about combining ingredients in a way that is just familiar enough to be crave-worthy, but with enough of a twist that makes you say “how did they do that?!”
