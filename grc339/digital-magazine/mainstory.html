                  The Honeyboys are one of SLO's hottest up and coming bands, mixing
                  indie, rock, and pop to create their own new wave.

            <h2>Honeyboys: On the Rise</h2>
            <p>
               Making a band is much different than it was prior to the social media
               age. Before, groups were usually created by utilizing whatever local
               talent a producer had at their disposal, hoping to create something
               with the sum of the parts. Nowadays, location has become much less of
               a factor, as social media has redefined what the word "local" truly
               means. Comprised of four different instrumentalists, rising boy-band
               Honeyboys was crafted in the chat rooms of Facebook, where four
               friends found similar sonic interests. After releasing a handful of
               well-received songs, the group looks to further establish themselves
               as a force, as they check into our pages for the first time with their
               new single "Green Tea."
            </p>
            <p>
               Ari Eisenberg, frontman of the SLO-based, genre-bending band is
               humble. This isn’t to say he shies away from the spotlight; you
               wouldn’t be able to detect his deference onstage. But when we sat down
               to talk the formation of Honeyboys, the death of the genre, and the
               SLO DIY scene, Ari told me Honeyboys is a project far beyond
               himself.In the past, he’s been the lead singer in alt-rock bands and
               put out hip-hop influenced solo projects, but when he met Matt Sato,
               Grady Gallagher, and Erin O’Rourke at a Cal Poly music production
               club, they set out to build Honeyboys as a collective.
            </p>
            <p>
               “I realized, I’d rather it be about the brand and about the image
               rather than about me. And that’s why I didn’t have Honeyboys be like,
               ‘Ari and the Honeyboys’ or something like that. I wanted it to be
               about the music that all of us create.”
            </p>
            <p>
               And Honeyboys was to set its sound apart from the indie-rock that
               dominates SLO’s DIY scene. It’s a sound Ari describes as “genreless”
               and Honeyboys’s Spotify bio describes as “progressive pop”. I ask him
               to break this down for me.
            </p>
            <p>
               “I feel like a lot of bands stick to like, ‘I’m a punk band, I’m just
               playing punk music,’ or ‘I’m a rock band,’ or a psychedelic band, or
               funk band, or whatever it is. With Honeyboys we really wanted to
               combine hip hop, jazz, and pop and just really produce the hell out of
               it. So I think ‘progressive’ just kind of means trying to combine as
               many genres as we can into one.”
            </p>
            <p>
               This anti-genre is cognizant of the “I listen to a little bit of
               everything” listener that Ari and many of us identify with. He
               idolizes trailblazers of genre-fusion like Dominic Fike and
               Brockhampton and is adamant about making music he would listen to.
            </p>

               <figcaption>
                  Honeyboys is on the up and up with well over 6,000 monthly listeners
                  on Spotify.
               </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
               On a local scale, Honeyboys has definitely made headway. They
               performed alongside bands Skogen and Couch Dog before the world
               closed, and while they are keeping on through these UnPreCeDenTed
               TiMeS, Ari reminisced about the house show intimacy we all miss
               dearly, despite the grime and sweat COVID has made us hyper-aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
               “I really like how supportive the SLO DIY scene is. We were pretty new
               into it, like mostly played smaller shows, but then I threw some house
               shows at my place and had some other bands play, and it was just
               really fun to have a community come together in an intimate setting.
               And it seemed like the reaction was really positive.”
            </p>
            <p>
               On a larger scale, Honeyboys is on the up and up. Both “Grapevine” and
               “I Just Wanna Know” individually have over 100,000 listens on Spotify,
               and the band has amassed well over 6,000 monthly listeners. While this
               is impressive to say the least, Ari told me his next goal is to reach
               100,000 monthly listeners.
            </p>
            <p>
               “That’s kind of a checkpoint for a lot of artists because that means
               you can support another artist or go on tour yourself. And one of the
               biggest long term goals is to go on a California tour. Because as much
               as I love recording and producing and doing all this fun stuff, I love
               performing live, like more than anything. So that’s really what I’m
               hoping to do. Just to play at some bigger venues.”
            </p>
            <p>
               In the immediate future, Honeyboys is looking to expand their brand by
               growing their team and experimenting with new forms of media, like Tik
               Tok and live-streaming platforms. Until then, they plan to release as
               much quality-over-quantity music as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
               “I mainly want to just put out music that I really love and that I
               feel like is perfect. Reese is also a perfectionist when it comes to
               recording and stuff. We realize that when we release something, it’s
               going to be out there forever. So why rush anything?”
            </p>
            <p>
               If you’re into music that blurs the lines of indie pop, jazz, rock,
               hip hop, and all else, Honeyboys’s EP is coming soon. In the meantime,
               you can peruse their discography and stream their new single “Maple
               Blue”, out now on Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, or wherever you
               get your music.

            <p>
               Honeyboys return with a new single titled “Green Tea,” a breezy and
               invigorating track that reminds you of a Blockbuster 80s romcom.
               Dripping with saccharine lyrics, “Green Tea” captures the weird ways
               romance binds people who have incompatible tastes. “She drinks coffee,
               I like green tea” chant Honeyboys. From its buoyant beginning to
               cathartic hooks, “Green Tea” keeps your mood flowing to all the right
               directions.

                  Honeyboys began their rise to fame by performing houseshows nearly
                  every weekend to spread awareness for their music.

                        After a two-year hiatus, Shabang Live Music and Arts Festival
                        will return to San Luis Obispo this spring. According to a news
                        release Thursday, the annual music festival, which was put on
                        hold in 2020 due to the pandemic, is scheduled to take place on
                        May 13 and 14 at Laguna Lake Park.

                     <p>
                        Over years of practice, drummers appear to modify the way that
                        the two sides of their brain communicate. According to a recent
                        study, the cabling that runs between the two hemispheres of a
                        drummer’s brain is significantly different from non-musicians.

                        that you want to be? Georg Voros shares more than 35 years of
                        experience as a drummer, clinician, educator, and composer in
                        this book that will help you get the most out of learning to
                        play drums or any other instrument.
