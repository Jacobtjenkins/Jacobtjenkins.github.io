            <h3>Honeyboys: On the Rise</h3>
            <p>
              Comprised of four different instrumentalists, rising boy-band
              Honeyboys was crafted in the chat rooms of Facebook, where four
              friends found similar sonic interests. After releasing a handful
              of well-received songs, the group looks to further establish
              themselves as a force, as they check into our pages for the first
              time with their new single "Green Tea."

            <h3>Craziest Rock Band Stories You've Never Heard</h3>
            <p>
              Tales of drinking, death, and debauchery that go way beyond sex,
              drugs, and rock and roll.These immortal words sum up the view that
              so many rock stars have held: The only problem with living hard is
              getting caught. For stars like Richards, drugs, booze, and an
              endless parade of lovers were just part of the lifestyle. In fact,
              the rock gods of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in particular seemed
              to be in a contest to see who could take things the farthest.

              <h3>Drumming Makes Your Brain More Efficient</h3>
              <p>
                Over years of practice, drummers appear to modify the way that
                the two sides of their brain communicate. According to a recent
                study, the cabling that runs between the two hemispheres of a
                drummer’s brain is significantly different from non-musicians.
